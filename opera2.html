<PRE><h3><b>BUT.</b></h3>
        Things are seldom what they seem,
        Skim milk masquerades as cream;
        Highlows pass as patent leathers;
        Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
        <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3>
            Very true,
            So they do.
     <h3><b>BUT.</b></h3>
        Black sheep dwell in every fold;
        All that glitters is not gold;
        Storks turn out to be but logs;
        Bulls are but inflated frogs.
     <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3>  
        So they be,
        Frequentlee.
     <h3><b>BUT.</b></h3> 
        Drops the wind and stops the mill;
        Turbot is ambitious brill;
        Gild the farthing if you will,
        Yet it is a farthing still.
     <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3> 
        Yes, I know.
        That is so.
        Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
        It is shady—it is shady;
        I don't see at what you're driving,
        Mystic lady—mystic lady.
        Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
        That the mystic lady's dealing
        In oracular revealing.
     <h3><b>BUT.</b></h3>
        Stern conviction's o'er him stealing,
        That the mystic lady's dealing
        In oracular revealing.
        Yes, I know—
        That is so!
     <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3>
        Though I'm anything but clever,
        I could talk like that for ever:
        Once a cat was killed by care;
        Only brave deserve the fair.
        Very true,
        So they do.
     <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3>
        Wink is often good as nod;
        Spoils the child who spares the rod;
        Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
        Dogs are found in many mangers.
     <h3><b>BUT.</b></h3> 
        Frequentlee,
        I agree.
        Paw of cat the chestnut snatches;
        Worn-out garments show new patches;
        Only count the chick that hatches;
        Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.
     <h3><b>BUT.</b></h3>
        Yes, I know,
        That is so.
     <h3><b>CAPT.</b></h3>
        Though to catch my drift he's striving,
        I'll dissemble—I'll dissemble;
        When he sees at what I'm driving,
        Let him tremble—let him tremble!</PRE>
