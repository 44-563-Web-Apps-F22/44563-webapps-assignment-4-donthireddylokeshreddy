                    SONG—CAPTAIN

                    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                    Bright regent of the heavens,
                    Say, why is everything
                    Either at sixes or at sevens?
                    I have lived hitherto
                    Free from breath of slander,
                    Beloved by all my crew—
                    A really popular commander.
                    But now my kindly crew rebel,
                    My daughter to a tar is partial,
                    Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
                    He threatens a court martial!
                    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                    Bright regent of the heavens,
                    Say, why is everything
                    Either at sixes or at sevens? </p>
                
<b> BUT.</b><p style="color:rgb(37, 185, 24)">How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
unconscious moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
be! Who is poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
on one so lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!</p>
             
<b>CAPT. </b><p style="color:blue">(coming down). Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
That is not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable to have
gone on shore at dusk.
BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
pale face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile before I go.</p>
<b>CAPT.</b><p style="color:blue">Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon me, and
all my old friends seem to have turned against me!BUT, Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
unjust to one, at least.</p>
<b>CAPT.</b><p style="color:blue">True, for you are staunch to me. (Aside.) If ever I gave my
heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this! (Aloud.) I am
touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
is, I fear I can never be more to you than a friend.
BUT, I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
rich and lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
woman has gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.</p>

DUET—LITTLE BUTTERCUP and CAPTAIN</p>
BUT,        
Things are seldom what they seem,
Skim milk masquerades as cream;
Highlows pass as patent leathers;
Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
CAPT.         (puzzled). Very true, So they do.
BUT.          Black sheep dwell in every fold;
              All that glitters is not gold;
              Storks turn out to be but logs;
              Bulls are but inflated frogs.
CAPT.         (puzzled).  So they be,
                Frequentlee.
BUT.         Drops the wind and stops the mill;
             Turbot is ambitious brill;
             Gild the farthing if you will,
             Yet it is a farthing still.
CAPT.        (puzzled). Yes, I know.
               That is so.
             Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
             It is shady—it is shady;
             I don't see at what you're driving,
             Mystic lady—mystic lady.
(Aside.)     Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
             That the mystic lady's dealing
             In oracular revealing.
BUT.         (aside).Stern conviction's o'er him stealing,
             That the mystic lady's dealing
             In oracular revealing.
                   Yes, I know—
                   That is so!
CAPT.        Though I'm anything but clever,
             I could talk like that for ever:
             Once a cat was killed by care;
             Only brave deserve the fair.
                   Very true,
                   So they do.
CAPT.        Wink is often good as nod;
             Spoils the child who spares the rod;
             Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
             Dogs are found in many mangers.
BUT.                 Frequentlee,
                   I agree.
             Paw of cat the chestnut snatches;
             Worn-out garments show new patches;
             Only count the chick that hatches;
             Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.
BUT.               Yes, I know,
                   That is so.
(Aside.)     Though to catch my drift he's striving,
             I'll dissemble—I'll dissemble;
             When he sees at what I'm driving,
             Let him tremble—let him tremble!

                         ENSEMBLE

            Though a mystic tone { I } borrow,you
            You will } learn the truth with sorrow,
            I shall
           Here to-day and gone to-morrow;
           Yes, I know—
           That is so!
           [At the end exit LITTLE BUTTERCUP melodramatically.

CAPT.      Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless feel that
           they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new misery is
           she referring? Time alone can tell!

                        Enter SIR JOSEPH

SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
            daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.
CAPT.       She won't do, Sir Joseph!
SIR JOSEPH.  I'm afraid not. The fact is, that although I have urged my
             suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official
             utterance,I have done so hitherto without success. How do you account for
             this?
CAPT.       Really, Sir Joseph, I hardly know. Josephine is of course
            sensible of your condescension.
SIR JOSEPH. She naturally would be.
CAPT.       But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her.
SIR JOSEPH. You think it does?
CAPT.       I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her social
            position is far below your own. It may be that she feels she is not
            worthy of you.
SIR JOSEPH. That is really a very sensible suggestion, and displays
             more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.
CAPT.        See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason with
             her and assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty
             that love levels all ranks, her respect for an official utterance might induce
             her to look upon your offer in its proper light.
SIR JOSEPH.  It is not unlikely. I will adopt your suggestion.But soft,
             she is here. Let us withdraw, and watch our opportunity.

             Enter JOSEPHINE from cabin. FIRST LORD and CAPTAIN retire

             SCENE—JOSEPHINE

             The hours creep on apace,
             My guilty heart is quaking!
             Oh, that I might retrace
             The step that I am taking!
             Its folly it were easy to be showing,
             What I am giving up and whither going.
             On the one hand, papa's luxurious home,
             Hung with ancestral armour and old brasses,
             Carved oak and tapestry from distant Rome,
             Rare "blue and white" Venetian finger-glasses,
             Rich oriental rugs, luxurious sofa pillows,
             And everything that isn't old, from Gillow's.
             And on the other, a dark and dingy room,
             In some back street with stuffy children crying,
             Where organs yell, and clacking housewives fume,
             And clothes are hanging out all day a-drying.
             With one cracked looking-glass to see your face in,
             And dinner served up in a pudding basin!

             A simple sailor, lowly born,
             Unlettered and unknown,
             Who toils for bread from early mom
             Till half the night has flown!
             No golden rank can he impart—
             No wealth of house or land—
             No fortune save his trusty heart
             And honest brown right hand!
             And yet he is so wondrous fair
             That love for one so passing rare,
             So peerless in his manly beauty,
             Were little else than solemn duty!
             Oh, god of love, and god of reason, say,
             Which of you twain shall my poor heart obey!

             SIR JOSEPH and CAPTAIN enter

SIR JOSEPH.   Madam, it has been represented to me that you are
               appalled
               by my exalted rank. I desire to convey to you officially my
               assurance,
               that if your hesitation is attributable to that circumstance, it is uncalled for.
JOS.            Oh! then your lordship is of opinion that married
                happiness is not
                inconsistent with discrepancy in rank?
SIR JOSEPH.     I am officially of that opinion.
JOS.            That the high and the lowly may be truly happy together,
                provided
                that they truly love one another?
SIR JOSEPH.     Madam, I desire to convey to you officially my
                opinion that
                love is a platform upon which all ranks meet.
JOS.            I thank you, Sir Joseph. I did hesitate, but I will
                hesitate no
longer. (Aside.) He little thinks how eloquently he has pleaded
                his
                rival's cause!

                 Though stupendous be his brain,

SIR JOSEPH.      Never mind the why and wherefore,
                 Love can level ranks, and therefore,
                 Though your nautical relation (alluding to CAPT.)
                 In my set could scarcely pass—
                 Though you occupy a station
                 In the lower middle class—
CAPT.            and      Ring the merry bells on board-ship,
SIR JOSEPH       Rend the air with warbling wild,

JOS.             Never mind the why and wherefore,
                 Love can level ranks, and therefore
                 I admit the jurisdiction;
                 Ably have you played your part;
                 You have carried firm conviction
                 To my hesitating heart.
CAPT.            and      Ring the merry bells on board-ship,
SIR JOSEPH.      Rend the air with warbling wild,
                 For the union of { my } lordship

      [Exit JOS.
CAPT.            Sir Joseph, I cannot express to you my delight at the
                 happy
                 result of your eloquence. Your argument was unanswerable.
SIR JOSEPH.      Captain Corcoran, it is one of the happiest
                 characteristics
                 of this glorious country that official utterances are invariably
                 regarded
                 as unanswerable.                                        [Exit SIR

                 my name's agin me, but I ain't as bad as I seem.
CAPT.            What would you with me?
DICK (mysteriously). I'm come to give you warning.
CAPT.            Indeed! do you propose to leave the Navy then?

                 Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
                 About a certain intimate relation,
                 Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.
BOTH.            The merry maiden and the tar.

CAPT.            Good fellow, in conundrums you are speaking,
                 Sing hey, the mystic sailor that you are;

                 I'll talk to Master Rackstraw in the morning:

CAPT.            Dick Deadeye—I thank you for your warning—I will at
                 once take
                 means to arrest their flight. This boat cloak will afford me
                 ample

                 enters from cabin on tiptoe, with bundle of necessaries, and
                 accompanied by LITTLE BUTTERCUP.

                 ENSEMBLE

                 Carefully on tiptoe stealing,
                 Breathing gently as we may,
                 Every step with caution feeling,
                 We will softly steal away.
(CAPTAIN stamps)—Chord.

ALL (much alarmed). Goodness me—
                 Why, what was that?

ALL. (reassured).    It was—it was the cat!
CAPT.            (producing cat-o'-nine-tails). They're right, it was the

ALL.             Pull ashore, in fashion steady,
                 Hymen will defray the fare,

                 With these sons of the brine,
                 For my excellent crew,
                 Though foes they could thump any,
                 Are scarcely fit company,
                 My daughter, for you.
CREW.            Now, hark at that, do!
                 Though foes we could thump any,
                 We are scarcely fit company
                 For a lady like you!

RALPH.           Proud officer, that haughty lip uncurl!
                 Vain man, suppress that supercilious sneer,
                 For I have dared to love your matchless girl,
                 A fact well known to all my messmates here!

CAPT.            Oh, horror!

RALPH and Jos.   { I } humble, poor, and lowly born,
                 He
                 The meanest in the port division—
                 The butt of epauletted scorn—

                 He is                         him

ALL.             He is an Englishman!
BOAT.            He is an Englishman!
                 For he himself has said it,
                 And it's greatly to his credit,
                 That he is an Englishman!

ALL.             That he is an Englishman!
BOAT.            For he might have been a Roosian,
                 A French, or Turk, or Proosian,
                 Or perhaps Itali-an!

ALL.             Or perhaps Itali-an!
BOAT.            But in spite of all temptations
                 To belong to other nations,
                 He remains an Englishman!

ALL.             For in spite of all temptations, etc.

CAPT. (trying to repress his anger).
                 In uttering a reprobation
                 To any British tar,
                 I try to speak with moderation,
                 But you have gone too far.
                 I'm very sorry to disparage
                 A humble foremast lad,
                 But to seek your captain's child in marriage,
                 Why damme, it's too bad

                 [During this, COUSIN HEBE and FEMALE RELATIVES have entered.

  ALL (shocked). Oh!
  CAPT.          Yes, damme, it's too bad!
  ALL.           Oh!
  CAPT.          and DICK DEADEYE. Yes, damme, it s too bad.

                 [During this, SIR JOSEPH has appeared on poop-deck. He is
                 horrified
                 at the bad language.

HEBE.            Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
                 Oh, the monster overbearing!
                 Don't go near him—don't go near him—
                 He is swearing—he is swearing!
SIR JOSEPH.      My pain and my distress,
                 I find it is not easy to express;
                 My amazement—my surprise—
                 You may learn from the expression of my eyes!
CAPT.            My lord—one word—the facts are not before
you
                 The word was injudicious, I allow—
                 But hear my explanation, I implore you,
                 And you will be indignant too, I vow!
SIR JOSEPH.      I will hear of no defence,
                 Attempt none if you're sensible.
                 That word of evil sense
                 Is wholly indefensible.
                 Go, ribald, get you hence
                 To your cabin with celerity.
                 This is the consequence
                 Of ill-advised asperity

                     [Exit CAPTAIN, disgraced, followed by
                 JOSEPHINE

ALL.             This is the consequence,
                 Of ill-advised asperity!
SIR JOSEPH.      For I'll teach you all, ere long,
                 To refrain from language strong
                 For I haven't any sympathy for ill-bred
                 taunts!
HEBE.            No more have his sisters, nor his cousins,
                 nor his
                 aunts.
ALL.             For he is an Englishman, etc.

SIR JOSEPH.      Now, tell me, my fine fellow—for you are a fine
                 fellow—
RALPH.           Yes, your honour.
SIR JOSEPH.      How came your captain so far to forget himself? I
                 am quite
                 sure you had given him no cause for annoyance.
                 RALPH, Please your honour, it was thus-wise. You see I'm only a
                 topman-
                -a mere foremast hand—
SIR JOSEPH.      Don't be ashamed of that. Your position as a topman
                 is a
                 very exalted one.
RALPH.           Well, your honour, love burns as brightly in the
                 fo'c'sle as it
                 does on the quarter-deck, and Josephine is the fairest bud that
                 ever
                 blossomed upon the tree of a poor fellow's wildest hopes.

                 Enter JOSEPHINE; she rushes to RALPH'S arms

JOS.             Darling! (SIR JOSEPH horrified.)
RALPH.           She is the figurehead of my ship of life—the bright
                 beacon that
                 guides me into my port of happiness—that the rarest, the purest
                 gem that
                 ever sparkled on a poor but worthy fellow's trusting brow!
ALL.             Very pretty, very pretty!
SIR JOSEPH.      Insolent sailor, you shall repent this outrage.
                 Seize him!
                 (Two Marines seize him and handcuff him.)
JOS.             Oh, Sir Joseph, spare him, for I love him tenderly.
SIR JOSEPH.      Pray, don't. I will teach this presumptuous mariner
                 to
                 discipline his affections. Have you such a thing as a dungeon on
                 board?
ALL.             We have!
DICK.            They have!
SIR JOSEPH.      Then load him with chains and take him there at
                 once!

                 OCTETTE

RALPH.           Farewell, my own,
                 Light of my life, farewell!
                 For crime unknown
                 I go to a dungeon cell.

JOS.             I will atone.
                 In the meantime farewell!
                 And all alone
                 Rejoice in your dungeon cell!

SIR JOSEPH.      A bone, a bone
                 I'll pick with this sailor fell;
                 Let him be shown at once
                 At once to his dungeon cell.

                 BOATSWAIN, DICK DEADEYE, and COUSIN HEBE

                 He'll hear no tone
                 Of the maiden he loves so well!
                 No telephone
                 Communicates with his cell!


                 (Fairies and Queen trip off, Iolanthe, who takes an affectionate
                 farewell of her son, going off last.)

                 flageolet.)
