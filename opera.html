                      I have lived hitherto
                      Free from breath of slander,
                      Beloved by all my crew—
                      A really popular commander.
                      But now my kindly crew rebel,
                      My daughter to a tar is partial,
                      Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
                      He threatens a court martial!

  unconscious moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
  be! Who is poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
  on one so lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!</p>

  That is not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable to have
  gone on shore at dusk.
  BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
  pale face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile before I go.</p>
<h3 class ="CAPT"><b>CAPT. </b></h3><p class = "speech">Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
  recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon me, and
  all my old friends seem to have turned against me!BUT, Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
  unjust to one, at least.</p>
<h3 class ="CAPT"><b>CAPT. </b></h3><p class = "speech"> for you are staunch to me. <p class="direction">    (Aside)</p> If ever I gave my
heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this!<p class="direction">    (Aloud)</p>  I am
touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
is, I fear I can never be more to you than a friend.
BUT, I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
rich and lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
woman has gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.</p>
